THE STORY:

The dinosaurs were smart. Very smart.


They saw the meteorite coming and the left earth before they died... sadly the human race did not see it coming.
About 167 years ago to be exact the humans were wiped out by the largest meteorite ever to be seen. Now there is only me, the invention of NASA.
Well, there is also some A.I.H's left, but there is not many. My only mission now is to wipe the dinosaurs out, just like the universe intended.

BTW, god never existed but some how L. Ron Hubbard got it right with scientology... Now, I remember why I do not miss the humans.
